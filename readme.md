# PlainTalk AI

## Project Idea
PlainTalk AI is an AI-powered education assistant that explains any topic in simple, clear language. It avoids jargon and provides concise explanations with examples and analogies, helping students understand concepts quickly and easily.

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend:** A simple web interface (React/HTML) with an input box for users to enter a topic.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (or Python Flask) to handle requests from the frontend.
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI API, which generates simplified explanations, analogies, and examples.
- **Workflow:**
  1. User enters a topic.
  2. Frontend sends request to backend (`POST /api/explain`).
  3. Backend sends the query to OpenAI API with a custom prompt.
  4. AI responds with a clear explanation, example, and analogy.
  5. Frontend displays the result to the user.

## Theoretical Implementation
PlainTalk AI addresses the common problem of students struggling with complex topics. Instead of searching across multiple resources, they can input a topic and instantly get a clear explanation. The system acts as a **personal AI tutor**, saving time and making learning more effective.
